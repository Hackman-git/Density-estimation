# Density-estimation
Write a Python program to calculate the density estimator of a histogram.  Use the field x in the NormalSample.csv file. 
a)	(5 points) According to Izenman (1991) method, what is the recommended bin-width for the histogram of x?

b)	(5 points) What are the minimum and the maximum values of the field x?

c)	(5 points) Let a be the largest integer less than the minimum value of the field x, and b be the smallest integer greater than the maximum value of the field x.  What are the values of a and b?

d)	(5 points) Use h = 0.25, minimum = a and maximum = b. List the coordinates of the density estimator.  Paste the histogram drawn using Python or your favorite graphing tools.

e)	(5 points) Use h = 0.5, minimum = a and maximum = b. List the coordinates of the density estimator.  Paste the histogram drawn using Python or your favorite graphing tools.

f)	(5 points) Use h = 1, minimum = a and maximum = b. List the coordinates of the density estimator. Paste the histogram drawn using Python or your favorite graphing tools.

g)	(5 points) Use h = 2, minimum = a and maximum = b. List the coordinates of the density estimator. Paste the histogram drawn using Python or your favorite graphing tools.

h)	(5 points) Among the four histograms, which one, in your honest opinions, can best provide your insights into the shape and the spread of the distribution of the field x?  Please state your arguments.
